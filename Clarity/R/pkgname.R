#' @title CLARITY: Comparison of simiLARITY Matrices
#'
#' @description
#' CLARITY is a package for "Modelling Similarity Matrices as Mixtures for structural comparison" based on an in-preparation paper of that name led by Daniel Lawson (dan.lawson@bristol.ac.uk). Start by looking at \code{\link{Clarity_Scan}}, which does a non-parametric fit of a single similarity matrix, which is then passed to \code{\link{Clarity_Predict}} for examining structural changes in a second similarity matrix. This can be plotted with \code{\link{Clarity_ComparisonPlot}}.

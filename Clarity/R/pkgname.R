#' @title CLARITY: Comparison of simiLARITY Matrices
#'
#' @description
#' This is the software for "CLARITY - Comparing heterogeneous data using dissimiLARITY" based on a paper of that name led by Daniel Lawson (dan.lawson@bristol.ac.uk).
#'
#' Start by looking at \code{\link{Clarity_Scan}}, which does a non-parametric fit of a single similarity matrix. This is used with \code{\link{Clarity_Predict}} for examining structural changes in a second similarity matrix.
#'
#' Plotting is via \code{\link{plot.ClarityScan}} for persistences, \code{\link{plot.Clarity}} for residuals, and \code{\link{Clarity_ObjectivePlot}} for objective functions.
#'
#' Uncertainty is handled via \code{\link{Clarity_Bootstrap}}.
#'
#' The code for Clarity and ClarityScan is hosted at https://github.com/danjlawson/CLARITY, where you can also find the code that generated the figures in the paper.

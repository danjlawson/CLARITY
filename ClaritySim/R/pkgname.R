#' @description
#' Simulate Similarity Matrices for comparison and use in Packages \code{\link[Clarity]{Clarity}}. This package generates random trees, random mixtures under those trees. It then allows randomly purturbing either the branch length or the topology of the tree, all the while reporting the similarity between objects which are themselves mixtures of tips of the tree. See \code{\link{simulateCoalescent}} for simulating a dataset under a tree, \code{\link{transformCoalescent}} for rescaling the tree branch lengths without changing the structure/topology, and \code{\link{mixCoalescent}} for adding a mixture into the topology which will change the structure.
